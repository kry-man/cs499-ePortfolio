<h2> Code Review </h2>

<br>

<p>The code review encompasses the original state of the enhancements in this portfolio. I walk through all the existing code and identify where the enhancements will be implemented.</p>

<h2> Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering </h2>

<br>

<p>The enhanced artifact is building on the CS-465 Full Stack Development I course’s Travlr Getaways Project. The original document was created on November 2, 2025, using an open-source template provided in my course, with its last update on December 12, 2025, for its final submission in CS-465. This project was originally created to transform a static HTML website and create a full-stack web application using a MEAN approach. </p>

<p>I purposely selected this artifact for enhancement because it reminded me a lot of the portal management work I do for my current employer, but it gave me the clarity and insights as to why and how some of the design choices created by the original developer function the way they do. In the course, I was only tasked with building out the travel page for the sake of an eight-week course; however, I really wanted to fully realize and develop the remaining pages to get more practice and challenge myself. Therefore, to further develop the software design and engineering, I created additional controllers, routes, .json files, and handlebars to make the rooms and meals pages transform from static to dynamic content. The enhancement demonstrates my ability to create a more cohesive, simple, faster, and cleaner web application by eliminating unnecessary and redundant code. It functions by using templates and loops to ensure better latency and design, so an individual can easily implement new rooms and meals by adding them to the .json files. </p>

<p>The enhancement supports the three outcomes I intended to. First, it employs strategies for building a collaborative environment to enable diverse audiences to support decision-making because it enhances both the external users and the internal administrators to have a better, streamlined application. The design is professional and coherent, with comments to aid audiences in understanding the enhancements, while also providing a sound web application for users to engage with that matches the experience from the original project’s travel page and now extends across the meals and rooms pages. Lastly, this ensures a more secure application to prevent exploitation because it forces data to be called from reading a file that is only accessible to the developer and administrator.</p>

<p>
One of the things I overlooked when putting this project forward was having to establish a new git connection to push my work to my portfolio. I had to create a new connection to the ePortfolio and then make a copy with a new name of the original “travlr” file location on my computer. I panicked at first, but then I realized it was to my advantage since it makes it easier for me to track the iterations of change and easily recall them as a backup if necessary. Once I got past this hurdle, it felt easier to proceed. The biggest challenge for me overall is that my enhancements are intertwined with each other, so it has been difficult to separate them. Overall, I am enjoying the process because it forces me to focus and make decisions about the unique needs for each page. </p>

<h2> Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures </h2>
<br>

<p>The enhanced artifact is building on the Travlr Getaways Project with the changes from Enhancement One. Enhancement one was last created and last updated on January 25, 2026, based on the original project from November 2, 2025, using an open-source template provided in my course, with its last update on December 12, 2025, for its final submission in CS-465. This project was originally created to transform a static HTML website and create a full-stack web application using a MEAN approach. </p>

<p>I purposely selected this artifact for enhancement because it supports growing my portal management skills that I utilize for my current employer. By further developing the application using a MEAN approach, I can find new ways to enhance existing portals to be dynamic and have better structures to output data to the different users engaging with it. In the course, I was only tasked with building out the travel page for customers and the travel administrative page for the eight-week course; however, I wanted to fully realize and develop the remaining pages to gain experience toward my long-term career goals. In order to further develop the algorithms and data structures, I implemented two new schemas under the “models” folder for the new databases I am connecting to the web application in Enhancement Three. The new schemas demonstrate my commitment to consistent data structures throughout a singular web application to ensure ease of use for both the end users, administrators, and developers. I ensured that the database connection was properly configured so that Enhancement Three will be ready for implementation.</p>

<p>The algorithms and data structures enhancement supports the four outcomes I intended to. It employs strategies for building a collaborative environment to enable diverse audiences to support decision-making because it enhances both the external user and the internal administrators to have a better structured application by implementing schemas and templates. The design is professional and coherent with comments to aid audiences in understanding the enhancements, while also providing a sound web application for users to engage with that provides consistency from the original project’s travel content to its meals and rooms content. By creating the schema for the upcoming database connections in Enhancement Three, I have ensured that the algorithm can adequately output the desired data in the format and structure that would enable simpler updates for developers. The enhancement required the use of innovative techniques and the use of skills to deliver value in the best industry practices.</p>

<p>I forgot that when putting the proposal for this project forward, I had to install a new mongoose connection for MongoDB so my web application can connect to the database. Since Enhancement One forced me to make a duplicate file to create my ePortfolio, I needed to install the mongoose packages for the new project to ensure the mongoose connection required to be a full-stack application. In doing so, I identified three vulnerabilities that I was able to fix to maintain current standards. I also had to rename the “rate” variable I created for rooms to “room_rate” to prevent a system default that I had not considered in the original naming as I built the schema. I verified that the database connection was set up and prepared to run with the newly developed structures, so that it will be prepared for Enhancement Three. </p>
