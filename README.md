<h2> Code Review </h2>
<br>

<p>The code review encompasses the original state of the enhancements in this portfolio. I walk through all the existing code and identify where the enhancements will be implemented.</p>

<h2> Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering </h2>
<br>

<p>The enhanced artifact is building on the CS-465 Full Stack Development I course’s Travlr Getaways Project. The original document was created on November 2, 2025, using an open source template provided in my course with its last update on December 12, 2025, for its final submission in CS-465. This project was originally created to transform a static HTML website and create a full stack web application using a MEAN approach. </p>

<p>I purposely selected this artifact for enhancement because it reminded me a lot of the portal management work I do for my current employer, but it gave me the clarity insights as to why and how some of the design choices created by the original developer function the way they do. In the course, I was only tasked with building out the travel page for the sake of an eight-week course; however, I really wanted to fully realize and develop the remaining pages to get more practice and challenge myself. Therefore, to further develop the software design and engineering, I created additional controllers, routes, .json files, and handlebars to make the rooms and meals pages transform from static to dynamic content. The enhancement demonstrates my ability to create a more cohesive, simple, faster, and cleaner web application by eliminating unnecessary and redundant code. It functions by using templates and loops to ensure better latency and design, so an individual can easily implement new room and meals by adding them to the .json files. </p>

<p>The enhancement supports the three outcomes I intended to. First, it employs strategies for building a collaborative environment to enable diverse audiences to support decision-making because it enhances both the external user and the internal administrators to have a better streamlined application. The design is professional and coherent with comments to aid audiences in understanding the enhancements, while also providing a sound web application for users to engage with that matches the experience from the original project’s travel page and now extends across the meals and rooms pages. Lastly, this ensures a more secure application to prevent exploitation because it forces data to be called from reading a file that is only accessible to the developer and administrator.</p>

<p>
One of the things I overlooked when putting this project forward was having to establish a new git connection to push my work to my portfolio. I had to create a new connection to the ePortfolio and then make a copy with a new name of the original “travlr” file location on my computer. I panicked at first, but then I realized it was to my advantage since it makes it easier for me to track the iterations of change and easily recall it as a backup if necessary. Once I got past this hurdle, it felt easier to proceed. The biggest challenge for me overall is that my enhancements are intertwined with each other, so it has been difficult to separate them. Overall, I am enjoying the process because it forces me to focus and make decisions about the unique needs for each page. </p>
